Hello 👋 !

Working with science in Brazil is a daily challenge. There are few funding opportunities available and their value is not enough to live on. Added to this, every day Brazilian science suffers from deep cuts in funding, which requires researchers to always look for other sources of income.

If my work helps you in any way or you simply want to support the work that I've been doing, please consider donating or even creating a membership subscription (if you can!). Your support will help me with my scientific pursuit and with the maintenance of the products I developed.

Thank you!
